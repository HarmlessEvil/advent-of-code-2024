## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where participants solve daily programming puzzles, each
released in the form of a two-part challenge. The challenges cover various topics, and participants often use the
opportunity to sharpen their problem-solving and coding skills.

## About My Approach

I was aiming to:

* utilize my knowledge of algorithms and data structures;
* make solutions as general as I could;
* prioritize code readability over how fast I can write the solution â€” I didn't try to compete on global leaderboard.
